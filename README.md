Credit Card Transaction Fraud Detection

The data set is taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection/data

The purpose of the project is to explore different machine learning models and ensure proper handling of imbalanced data to detect fraudulent transactions.

To handle imbalanced data, I used an oversampling and undersampling technique, SMOTE and Tomek Links.

The models I used to train on were Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest and XGBoosted trees.
