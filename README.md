# Credit Card Transaction Fraud Detection

The data set "fraudTrain.csv" is taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection/data

The purpose of the project is to explore different machine learning models and ensure proper handling of imbalanced data to detect fraudulent transactions.

- I applied exploratory data analysis to identify patterns between features and the data.
- To handle imbalanced data, I used an oversampling and undersampling technique, SMOTE and Tomek Links.
- The models I used to train on were Random Forest, AdaBoosted and XGBoosted trees.
- In the end, I analyzed the models used with SHAP values to look at feature importance and relationships.
